My idea
"Use of Machine Learning to predict earthquake disaster and rescue of survivor"
Natural disasters cause massive casualities,damages and leave many injure.Human beings cannot stop them but timely prediction and due safety measures can prevent human life losses and many precious objects can be saved.Earthquake is one of the major catastrophes.Unlike other disasters there is no particular mechanism for earthquake prediction,which make it even more destructive.It can be tried by many scientist for prediction of earthquake by electric field,magnetic field,animal behavior etc,But due to advancement of machine learning,It become possible to predict earthquake area and magnitude to some range.
                           Active Earthquake region are those which mainly fall in the circum-Pacific seismic belt
where about 81% of the world's largest earthquakes occur. and other belt is Alphide Belt,which strectches from the Azores through the mediterranean and middle east of the Himalayas and indonesia.
An earthquake prediction mechanism that can give confident predictions is,indeed,the need of an hour.Atrigger generated by such system can enable authorities to moblize resources, shutdown major damage causing system like nuclear power plants and electricity supply in order to prevent casualities.
                            My idea of using earthquake prediction encompasses a set of input parameters extracted from temporal distribution of past earthquake happen in those area. Such temporal distribution of past earthquake distribution illustrate the frequency of occurance of seismic events as a function of [their magnitudes.My goal is to find the relationship between seismic activity and geophysical fact.This accumulation of energy in the faults may leads to the occurance of the earthquake and the energy stored is related to the magnitude of upcoming earthquakes.The Gutenberg-Richter inverse power law shows relation between the earthquake magnitude and the cumulative frequency of events less than or equal to the corresponding magnitudes.The mathematically calculated seismicity indicators from the previously occured seismic events show the seismic behaviour of the region,which are used as input to the different ML approach.
                           My approach through ML is also to take the Heat map after the disaster through the satellite image and tell the authorities where the Ambulance needed the most and evaluate the shortest path for ambulance to approach their.Also big crane is needed to remove the collapse part of building.In earthquake the major problem is to the connectivity,electricity,dust particles,to save people who get struck in the collapse building etc. My approach is also to provide people to the safe zone,relief camp area.ML can accurately map disaster areas with close to real-time adjustments for new developments, and model scenarios where disease or contamination might spread. It can analyze social media feeds to identify where people need help, or who is offering to help. And machine learning and deep learning techniques can accelerate the analysis of incoming data (from victims, response crews, and others) to develop a clear picture of whatâ€™s going on, and could help coordinate efforts.
